# Svaeva System Development Kit (SDK)

## Introduction
Problem: Grounding Language Agents in the real-world involves  integration across many different data types and calls to external APIs. For instance, integration across audio, visual, and physiological information about a human user. These might occur as real-time data streams. Furthermore, we want to be able to store incoming and generated data in databases that allow easy storage and retrieval, everything from building a simple action history to building a more sophisticated RAG application. How does one easily create a language agent such that we can integrate these multi-modal data streams and data storage/retrieval together with external APIs?

Solution: Svaeva tries to solve this problem by allowing developers to construct ways of deploying agents that involves many different kinds of calls to external APIs handling different incoming data types. Essentailly, Svaeva is a meta-wrapper around RESTful APIs, connected to a database where incoming requests and outgoing results are stored and managed across different users appropriately.

### Skeletons

#### Description

Skeletons are Dictionary how allow to warp any API to make it compatible with the svaeva.

[Docs](https://github.com/Daisie-Bell/VRest)

#### Usage

##### How to add list of skeletons?
```python
if client.multi_api.skeleton.loaded == []:
    file_ = open("Blue_paper.json","r")
    skeletons = file_.read()
    skeletons = json.loads(skeletons)
    for i in skeletons:
        row_data = {
            "type_model": skeletons[i]["type_model"],
            "skeleton": skeletons[i]["v_rest"]
        }
        client.multi_api.skeleton.__setattr__(i.lower(),row_data)
```

This code loads a list of skeletons from a JSON file called "Blue_paper.json", converts the JSON data to a Python dictionary, and adds each skeleton to the `Panel` object using the `__setattr__` method.

##### How to add one skeleton?

To set skeleton, use the following code:

```python
client.multi_api.skeleton.<id> = {
    "type_model": <type_model>,
    "skeleton": <skeleton>
}
```

##### How to update a skeleton?

To update a skeleton, use the following code:

```python
client.multi_api.skeleton.<id> = {
    "type_model": <type_model>,
    "skeleton": <skeleton>
}
```

##### How to load all skeletons?

To list all available skeletons, use the following code:

```python
print(client.multi_api.skeleton())
```

##### How to load skeleton by ID?

To list a specific skeleton by ID or model type, use the following code:

```python
print(client.multi_api.skeleton(id="open_ai"))
print(client.multi_api.skeleton(model_type="llm"))
```

To load a specific skeleton by ID or model type, use the following code:

```python
print(client.multi_api.skeleton.open_ai)
```

##### How to load all the skeletons to Svaeva?

To list all loaded skeletons, use the following code:

```python
print(client.multi_api.skeleton.loaded)
```

##### How to delete a skeleton?

To delete a skeleton, use the following code:

```python
del client.multi_api.skeleton.<id>
```

    }
}
```
